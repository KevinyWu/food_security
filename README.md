An analysis of food security in the United States using data from the USDA ERS Food Access Research Atlas and the US Census Bureau. Analysis includes:
- Food access across rural/urban, race, and age ([demography.ipynb](https://github.com/KevinyWu/food_security/blob/main/demography.ipynb))
- Ranking of states by food insecurity ([geography.ipynb](https://github.com/KevinyWu/food_security/blob/main/geography.ipynb))
- Correlation between median income and poverty with food insecurity ([income_poverty.ipynb](https://github.com/KevinyWu/food_security/blob/main/income_poverty.ipynb))

Findings are summarized in [Food_Security_in_the_United_States.pdf](https://github.com/KevinyWu/food_security/blob/main/Food_Security_in_the_United_States.pdf).
